<h2>Want to invest in real estate but don't have crazy funds........don't worry</h2>
<h1>UrEstae</h1><h2>is here</h2>
<p class="parahome">UrEstate is a platform which we our building to make investment in real estate easy and accessible to small scale investment. Through this platform we plan to make a SPV: Special Purpose Vehicle. SPV is a special company that will own a property on behalf of many investors. Investors will get certain rights of owning the property. It will also have a maturity period, after that maturity period the property will be sold and profits earned will be distributed among shareholders. It is more beneficial than holding property directly as to do so we have to follow SEBI guidelines of minimum shares which can be solved through SPV. Investors will also get easy interface and help from our management </p>
